# Moorpark CS Student Examples and Documents
It's a bit empty for now, but this is a place where you can read and write examples relevant to your course work. If you are confused by something, feel free to ask, add comments, etc. or you can download them yourself and play around with them, see what works and what doesn't!

Feel free to practice your Git skills here and make changes and improvements to any code or documents here. The `anything-goes` branch is for anyone to do literally anything. The master branch will be kept tidy, but you may submit your work as a pull request and as long as it runs (if it's code), follows the style guide, and is useful to others, it'll be accepted! We'll let you know if anything doesn't look right.
